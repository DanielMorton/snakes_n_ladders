A collection of modules for simulating random walks. Initially random walks on a traditional Snakes and Ladders board so I could investigate statistics
(expected value, standard deviation, kurtosis, etc) about the expected time to completion from each square. Later, I added similar functionality for computing the expected time to a given vertex
for random walks on regular polytopes.
